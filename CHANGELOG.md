## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-31

First public release.

### Added

- **Threads.** Each tab is a live Claude Code session through the Claude Agent SDK: one long-running query per
  thread in streaming-input mode, so every message continues the same conversation and reuses the prompt cache.
  Replies stream in, tool calls show as one-line rows, file edits show as `+12 −3 path` rows that open a diff.
  Messages typed while Claude works are queued and can be edited, removed or sent now.
- **Thread management.** Working and waiting states, pin, snooze, close and archive; background threads that run in
  auto permission mode; threads can start, message and wait for each other through Hive's own tools.
- **Composer.** A `/` command menu, model and effort pickers, `ultrathink` highlighting, image paste and drop,
  a one-click clipboard suggestion, and a live status strip for `/goal`, loops, workflows and subagents.
- **Session history and search.** Every past Claude Code session in the sidebar; hybrid search over them with BM25
  (MiniSearch) and local MiniLM embeddings fused by reciprocal rank, with the model running in a worker thread.
- **In-process MCP tools** for the agent: show a file in the preview panel, add a to-do, search past sessions,
  organize the thread, open a git worktree, drive the dev stack, run Codex as a subagent, talk to other threads,
  and create and manage watchers.
- **A worktree per thread.** The agent works in a git worktree made for its branch or ticket; closing or archiving
  the thread saves uncommitted work as a WIP commit and removes the worktree, keeping the branch.
- **Git panel.** Repos under the workspace and their worktrees: stage, unstage, commit (hooks always run), branch,
  log and push on click, with split or unified diffs. No discard, reset or force actions.
- **Files and preview.** A file tree with VS Code style git colours; a preview panel for images, HTML, PDF, video and
  text, served through a sandboxed custom protocol.
- **Terminal drawer.** A real shell per thread (node-pty) that survives switching tabs; closing it ends the whole
  process tree.
- **Watchers.** Scheduled background agents, each a folder with its own long-lived thread, prompt, memory, SQLite
  database, reports and findings; fixed intervals, daily and weekly report slots, or an adaptive interval that
  follows the weekly usage limit.
- **Ops panels.** Pull latest across repos, a dev stack runner (docker compose services and local processes),
  a deploy wizard driven by your own scripts, a scripts panel for recurring commands, and a daily Dependabot
  reviewer that only reports.
- **To-dos** that you and Claude can add to, with due dates and statuses.
- **Settings tab** for every feature, stored in one settings file; credential-looking keys stay in `.env`.
- **Status bar** with MCP connections, plan and 5-hour / 7-day usage, context size and prompt-cache countdown.
- **Hooks and plugins** switches for Claude Code settings, with a backup before every write.
- **Engineering.** Vitest suite (unit tests for the pure cores, integration tests against real git, pty and
  Python), ESLint with typescript-eslint and react-hooks, GitHub Actions CI on Windows and Ubuntu, and an
  electron-builder Windows installer and portable build published from version tags.
